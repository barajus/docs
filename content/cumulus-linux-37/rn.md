### Open issues in 3.7.12

|  Issue ID 	|   Description	|   Affects	|   Fixed |
|---	        |---	        |---	    |---	                |
| <a name="CM-28992"></a> [CM-28992](#CM-28992) <a name="CM-28992"></a> | The following security vulnerability has been announced:<br/>CVE-2020-10531: An issue was discovered in International Components for Unicode (ICU) for C/C++ through 66.1. An integer overflow, leading to a heap-based buffer overflow, exists in the UnicodeString::doAppend() function in common/unistr.cpp. | 3.0.0-3.7.12 | |
| <a name="CM-28968"></a> [CM-28968](#CM-28968) <a name="CM-28968"></a> | The EVPN `advertise-svi-ip` command does not withdraw routes.<br/>To work around this issue, run the `systemctl restart frr.service` command. | 3.7.9-3.7.12 | |
| <a name="CM-28944"></a> [CM-28944](#CM-28944) <a name="CM-28944"></a> | A change in a route map prefix list that should remove a route might not be reflected in the ospf6 database or in peers, and the route might not be deleted. <br/>To work around this issue, reenter the `redistribute <connected\|static> route-map <route-map-name>` statement in the configuration. | 3.6.2-3.7.12 | |
| <a name="CM-28940"></a> [CM-28940](#CM-28940) <a name="CM-28940"></a> | If you configure `aggregate-address <address> summary-only` before a component of the same aggregate is injected into the BGP table with the `network` or `redistribute` command, when you remove the `aggregate-address` configuration, the component stays suppressed; it is not advertised to peers. For example:<br/>Existing configuration:<br /><pre>router bgp 1<br /> address-family ipv4 unicast<br />  aggregate-address 50.0.0.0/8 summary-only<br /> exit-address-family<br /></pre><br />If you add `network 50.0.0.1/32`, you see the following (expected) BGP table entries:<br /><pre>Status codes: s suppressed, d damped, h history, * valid, > best, = multipath,<br />              i internal, r RIB-failure, S Stale, R Removed<br />Origin codes: i - IGP, e - EGP, ? - incomplete<br />   Network          Next Hop            Metric LocPrf Weight Path<br />*> 50.0.0.0         0.0.0.0                            32768 i<br />s> 50.0.0.1/32      0.0.0.0                  0         32768 i<br /></pre><br />Removing `aggregate-address 50.0.0.0/8 summary-only` at this point results in the following (unexpected) BGP table entry:<br /><pre>Status codes: s suppressed, d damped, h history, * valid, > best, = multipath,<br />              i internal, r RIB-failure, S Stale, R Removed<br />Origin codes: i - IGP, e - EGP, ? - incomplete<br />   Network          Next Hop            Metric LocPrf Weight Path<br />s> 50.0.0.1/32      0.0.0.0                  0         32768 i<br /></pre><br />To work around this issue, remove, then re-add the component prefix routes. | 3.7.12 | |
| <a name="CM-28938"></a> [CM-28938](#CM-28938) <a name="CM-28938"></a> | When you install an ACL LOG/DROP rule on a layer 3 ingress interface that is a member of a VRF, traffic that matches this rule is not logged and is still forwarded.<br/>To work around this issue, apply the ACL LOG/DROP rule to the VRF device itself or to the layer 2 VNI. | 3.7.6-3.7.12 | |
| <a name="CM-28867"></a> [CM-28867](#CM-28867) <a name="CM-28867"></a> | The QuantaMesh BMS T3048-LY8 switch shows a low fan RPM in syslog. | 3.7.5-3.7.12 | |
| <a name="CM-28816"></a> [CM-28816](#CM-28816) <a name="CM-28816"></a> | The following security advisory has been announced for bash: <br/>CVE-2019-18276 Qualys scan QID 372268 setuid vulnerability<br/>When bash or bash scripts are run setuid, bash is supposed to drop privileges, but does so incorrectly, so that an attacker with command access to the shell can use `enable -f` for runtime loading of a new builtin that calls `setuid()` to regain dropped privileges.<br/>To work around this issue, do not make bash or bash scripts `setuid`. | 3.0.0-3.7.12 | |
| <a name="CM-28754"></a> [CM-28754](#CM-28754) <a name="CM-28754"></a> | On switches with the Trident2+ ASIC, adding SPAN rules disables PBR rules. | 3.7.3-3.7.12 | |
| <a name="CM-28658"></a> [CM-28658](#CM-28658) <a name="CM-28658"></a> | The OVSDB log contains duplicate MAC addresses with the well-known BFD MAC address (00:23:20:00:00:01). This is mainly cosmetic, but clutters the log. | 3.7.12 | |
| <a name="CM-28657"></a> [CM-28657](#CM-28657) <a name="CM-28657"></a> | The BFD session to the NSX controller sometimes remains down. | 3.7.12 | |
| <a name="CM-28656"></a> [CM-28656](#CM-28656) <a name="CM-28656"></a> | In OVSDB VLAN-aware mode, removing a VTEP binding on the NSX controller fails to clean up all interfaces associated with the logical switch. | 3.7.12 | |
| <a name="CM-28655"></a> [CM-28655](#CM-28655) <a name="CM-28655"></a> | When you remove, then re-add an NSX VTEP binding, the VXLAN VTEP interface is not recreated. | 3.6.1-3.7.12 | |
| <a name="CM-28613"></a> [CM-28613](#CM-28613) <a name="CM-28613"></a> | In EVPN Active-Active (MLAG) environments, rebooting one member of an MLAG pair should result in the local MAC mobility sequence number reverting to 0. Sometimes a reboot of one MLAG peer results in the local MAC mobility sequence number being set to a non-zero value despite that no more mobility events occur. This issue is cosmetic only, as BGP does not advertise the incorrect sequence number and forwarding entries correctly point to the remote VTEP where the MAC is now located. | 3.7.12 | |
| <a name="CM-28611"></a> [CM-28611](#CM-28611) <a name="CM-28611"></a> | In an EVPN Active-Active (MLAG) environment, sometimes a local-to-remote MAC mobility event results in the local sequence number appearing higher than the remote sequence number in zebra. This issue is cosmetic only, as BGP does not advertise the incorrect sequence number and forwarding entries correctly point to the remote VTEP where the MAC is now located. | 3.7.12 | |
| <a name="CM-28533"></a> [CM-28533](#CM-28533) <a name="CM-28533"></a> | On the Lenovo NE0152T switch, one power supply (PSU2) always show as ABSENT in smonctl. | 3.7.11-3.7.12 | |
| <a name="CM-28488"></a> [CM-28488](#CM-28488) <a name="CM-28488"></a> | The following CVEs were announced that affect the cron package.  All of these require untrusted local user access.CVE-2017-9525 is a local user privilege escalation attack: In the cron package through 3.0pl1-128 on Debian, and through 3.0pl1-128ubuntu2 on Ubuntu, the postinst maintainer script allows for group-crontab-to-root privilege escalation via symlink attacks against unsafe usage of the chown and chmod programs.<br/>CVE-2019-9704, CVE-2019-9705, CVE-2019-9706 are local user denial of service attacks.  Note: the fix for CVE-2019-9705 imposes a limitation on the length of a crontab file (the vulnerability was that an unlimited size crontab file could cause excessive memory consumption).<br/><a href="https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/DLA-1723-1" class="external-link" rel="nofollow">https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/DLA-1723-1</a> | 3.0.0-3.7.12 | |
| <a name="CM-28487"></a> [CM-28487](#CM-28487) <a name="CM-28487"></a> | The following CVE was announced for rsyslog:<br/>CVE-2019-17041 CVE-2019-17042<br/>`rsyslogd`, when receiving remote log messages and using optional pmaixforwardedfrom or pmcisconames parser modules (not enabled by default on Cumulus Linux), is vulnerable to CVE-2019-17041 and CVE-2019-17042 where malicious messages that appear to be from AIX or Cisco respectively may be caused to skip sanity checks, resulting in incorrect negative lengths causing heap overflows.<br/>Do not enable (with $UDPServerRun or $InputTCPServerRun) receiving syslog messages from other hosts by the network. Also, do not enable (with $ModLoad) the vulnerable parsers pmaixforwardedfrom or pmcisconames.\<br/>The default `/etc/rsyslog.conf` file on Cumulus Linux does NOT enable `$UDPServerRun` or `$InputTCPServerRun`, so the vulnerability is not network exploitable in the default configuration. In addition, the vulnerable parsers are not enabled in the default configuration. | 3.0.0-3.7.12 | |
| <a name="CM-28465"></a> [CM-28465](#CM-28465) <a name="CM-28465"></a> | When you try to configure `link-down` on a parent interface of a subinterface configured in a VRF, you encounter an error. | 3.7.11-3.7.12 | |
| <a name="CM-28462"></a> [CM-28462](#CM-28462) <a name="CM-28462"></a> | On rare occasions, when you upgrade Cumulus Linux with the `apt-get upgrade` command, the upgrade fails and reports `No space left on device`. Checking the disk utilization shows that the disk is not full.<br/>To work around this issue, run the `apt-get upgrade` command again and reboot the device if prompted to complete the upgrade. | 3.7.10-3.7.12 | |
| <a name="CM-28451"></a> [CM-28451](#CM-28451) <a name="CM-28451"></a> | An error similar to the following shows in syslog:<br /><pre>2020-02-12T19:59:22.208012+08:00 leaf01 sx_sdk: RM_TABLE: No resources available to add 1 entries to KVD hash Table HW resource<br />2020-02-12T19:59:22.208124+08:00 leaf01 sx_sdk: PORT: __port_vport_fid_set err = (No More Resources)<br /></pre><br />To work around this issue, reboot the switch. | 3.7.11-3.7.12 | |
| <a name="CM-28442"></a> [CM-28442](#CM-28442) <a name="CM-28442"></a> | PTM mis-detects incorrect hostnames of LLDP neighbors and does not fail them as expected. Instead they end up in an N/A cabling status. | 3.7.11-3.7.12 | |
| <a name="CM-28441"></a> [CM-28441](#CM-28441) <a name="CM-28441"></a> | If a LLDP neighbor advertises a `PortDescr` that contains commas, `ptmctl -d` splits the string on the commas and misplaces its components in other columns. | 3.7.11-3.7.12 | |
| <a name="CM-28393"></a> [CM-28393](#CM-28393) <a name="CM-28393"></a> | On the Dell S5232F-ON switch, EVPN and dynamic VRF route leaking results in the CPU forwarding traffic to newly-learned type-2 routes.<br/>To work around this issue, restart FRR. | 3.7.9-3.7.12 | |
| <a name="CM-28376"></a> [CM-28376](#CM-28376) <a name="CM-28376"></a> | On the Dell S5232F-ON switch, the output of `ledmgrd` shows `amber_blinking` but `smonctl` shows all OK. | 3.7.11-3.7.12 | |
| <a name="CM-28374"></a> [CM-28374](#CM-28374) <a name="CM-28374"></a> | When traffic from a double tag interface (facing a different site) is forwarded via VXLAN, the inner tag is not removed. The destination does not know this tag, so it discards it. | 3.7.8-3.7.12 | |
| <a name="CM-28372"></a> [CM-28372](#CM-28372) <a name="CM-28372"></a> | On the EdgeCore AS7326-56X switch, the default fan speed, which is defined in the thermal specification, results in excessive fan noise. | 3.7.11-3.7.12 | |
| <a name="CM-28371"></a> [CM-28371](#CM-28371) <a name="CM-28371"></a> | On the Lenovo NE0152T switch, one power supply (PSU2) always show as ABSENT in smonctl. | 3.7.11-3.7.12 | |
| <a name="CM-28340"></a> [CM-28340](#CM-28340) <a name="CM-28340"></a> | Mellanox switches with the Spectrum A0 ASIC that are integrated with VMware NSX experience BFD connectivity issues with service nodes. As a result, VXLAN tunnels do not work.<br/>Mellanox switches with the Spectrum A1 ASIC do *<b>not</b>* have this issue. | 3.7.11-3.7.12 | |
| <a name="CM-28331"></a> [CM-28331](#CM-28331) <a name="CM-28331"></a> | When you add a route map to advertise IPv4 unicast in a BGP EVPN configuration and the route map contains a set operation, BGP crashes. | 3.7.11-3.7.12 | |
| <a name="CM-28223"></a> [CM-28223](#CM-28223) <a name="CM-28223"></a> | The following security vulnerability has been announced in qemu, which is not installed by default on Cumulus Linux but is available in the repository for optional installation:<br/>CVE-2020-1711: block: iscsi: OOB heap access via an unexpected response of iSCSI Server | 3.0.0-3.7.12 | |

| <a name="CM-28136"></a> [CM-28136](#CM-28136) <a name="CM-28136"></a> | The MLAG switch pair has VLANs defined that are not used on MLAG bonds. These VLANs still synchronize MAC addresses across to the peer switch. This results in log messages that indicate a MAC address is installed and the VLAN is not defined; for example:<br /><pre>RTM_NEWNEIGH with unconfigured vlan XXXX on port peerlink<br /></pre><br /> | 3.7.10-3.7.12 | |
| <a name="CM-28086"></a> [CM-28086](#CM-28086) <a name="CM-28086"></a> | The `ospfd` daemon might crash with the following kernel trace: <br /><pre>2019-11-06T23:00:08.261749+09:00 cumulus ospfd&#91;5339&#93;: Assertion 'node' failed in file ospfd/ospf_packet.c, line 671, function ospf_write<br /></pre><br /> | 3.7.11-3.7.12 | |
| <a name="CM-28080"></a> [CM-28080](#CM-28080) <a name="CM-28080"></a> | TACACS+ through ClearPass is not currently supported. Cumulus Linux sends authorization before authentication, but ClearPass does not accept an authorization before the user is authenticated. | 3.7.11-3.7.12 | |
| <a name="CM-28078"></a> [CM-28078](#CM-28078) <a name="CM-28078"></a> | On the Broadcom switch with the Trident3 ASC, packet priority remark values assigned from each internal CoS value continue to work with default values; if you change the internal CoS value, the change does not take effect. | 3.7.11-3.7.12 | |
| <a name="CM-28076"></a> [CM-28076](#CM-28076) <a name="CM-28076"></a> | After you hot swap a PSU, the `decode-syseeprom -t psuX` command shows the old PSU information (such as the serial number), until you run the `decode-syseeprom --init` command. | 3.6.0-3.7.12 | |
| <a name="CM-28061"></a> [CM-28061](#CM-28061) <a name="CM-28061"></a> | On switches with the Trident3 ASIC, PFC is not working as expected. If you set the PFC for only one CoS,  pause frames are sent for all CoS traffic. | 3.7.11-3.7.12 | |

| <a name="CM-27586"></a> [CM-27586](#CM-27586) <a name="CM-27586"></a> | CPU usage might be higher than normal if you have a high number of interfaces x VLANs and `lldpd` is active. This issue is introduced with code changes in Cumulus Linux 3.7.11, where VLAN information is now available for LLDP to advertise to neighbors (<a href="https://docs.cumulusnetworks.com/version/cumulus-linux-37/Layer-2/Link-Layer-Discovery-Protocol/#vlan-dot1-tlv" class="external-link" rel="nofollow">https://docs.cumulusnetworks.com/version/cumulus-linux-37/Layer-2/Link-Layer-Discovery-Protocol/#vlan-dot1-tlv</a>). You might see high CPU usage even if VLAN (dot1) TLV configuration is disabled. <br/>To check if `lldpd` is the heavy CPU resource user, run the following command:<br /><pre>cumulus&#64;switch:~$  ps -eo user,pid,ppid,cmd,%mem,%cpu --sort=-%cpu \| head<br /></pre><br />Alternatively, check for messages in the `/var/log/syslog` directory similar to:<br /><pre>2020-02-20T15:02:12.137857-05:00 leaf01 sysmonitor: High CPU use: 87%<br />2020-02-20T15:02:12.482398-05:00 leaf01 sysmonitor:   PID USER      PR    VIRT    RES %CPU %MEM     TIME+ COMMAND<br />2020-02-20T15:02:12.483112-05:00 leaf01 sysmonitor:  1570 _lldpd    20   73244  13800 76.6  0.3   4:43.06 lldpd<br /></pre><br /><b>Note</b>: The exact amount of CPU usage varies in each network based on a number of factors; however, it is unusual for `lldpd` to consume more than 30% CPU for an extended period of time.<br/>To work around this issue, you can do one of the following:<ul>	<li>If the large number of VLANs is not absolutely necessary, manually prune the VLAN allowed list (if you use the range 1-2999, modify the `bridge-vids` list to include the VLANs being used).</li>	<li>Stop the `lldpd` service. (This approach might be undesirable if the switch is providing services that rely on LLDP such as Voice VLAN.) To stop the `lldpd` service (runtime setting), run the `sudo systemctl stop lldpd.service` command. To disable the `lldpd` service upon boot, run `sudo systemctl disable lldpd.service`.</li></ul> | 3.7.11-3.7.12 | |

Cumulus Linux uses `uboot` directly instead of `grub` to boot the kernel. Uboot needs a special header to boot the kernel, which is not present. Without this header, when you use the `apt upgrade` command to upgrade Linux packages, `uboot` is unable to boot up the kernel. <br/>To work around this issue, upgrade Cumulus Linux by installing the disk image. Run the `onie-select` command to go into ONIE, and then use the `nos-install` command in ONIE to install a new binary image.<br/>This workaround only works when an out-of-band network is present. | 3.7.11-3.7.12 | |

| <a name="CM-28077"></a> [CM-28077](#CM-28077) | An unhandled exception might occur after you run the `sudo poectl -i` command. In addition, random `poed` daemon restarts can occur without any unhandled exceptions but with an invalid response length error. Both issues can occur due to a SerialException.<br/>To work around this issue, power cycle the switch. A software reboot does not resolve the issue. | 3.7.10-3.7.11 | |
| <a name="CM-28065"></a> [CM-28065](#CM-28065) | Editing the outbound route-map of a BGP peer causes all received prefixes by that BGP peer to reset and reinstall. This might cause a brief impact to traffic for those prefixes. | 3.7.11 | |
| <a name="CM-28048"></a> [CM-28048](#CM-28048) | On the Lenovo NE2580 switch, the fan speeds are higher than expected within normal operating conditions. | 3.7.11 | |

| <a name="CM-28016"></a> [CM-28016](#CM-28016) | On the Mellanox Spectrum switch, `switchd` can sometimes fail when PBR rules are installed or removed from hardware if the rule is setting a next hop learned via a routing protocol. | 3.7.7-3.7.11 | |
| <a name="CM-28007"></a> [CM-28007](#CM-28007) | When you configure Cumulus Linux with a /32 address on a switch port with a configured peer address (for example, to connect to a device using IP unnumbered), the switch sends GARPs for the peer address. | 3.7.5-3.7.11 | |
| <a name="CM-27947"></a> [CM-27947](#CM-27947) | Broadcom Field Alert - SID - MMU 2B Errors<br/>A few of the MMU memories on Broadcom switches are grouped together with single parity control. During SER correction when a parity error occurs on one of those groups, other memory in that group might also report a SER error. This occurs when the memory is accessed either by a packet hit or through a schan operation. This issue can cause SER errors in other memory and cause traffic mis-forwarding or a packet drop. | 3.7.0-3.7.11 | |
| <a name="CM-27927"></a> [CM-27927](#CM-27927) | On the Delta AG6248C switch, the NCLU `net show system sensors` command shows an error:<br /><pre>Could not collect output from command: &#91;'/usr/sbin/smonctl'&#93;<br /></pre><br />To work around this issue, run the `net show system sensors json` command instead. | 3.7.11 | |

| <a name="CM-27683"></a> [CM-27683](#CM-27683) | The following CVEs were announced that affect the Linux kernel:<br/>CVE-2019-12378: An issue was discovered in ip6_ra_control in net/ipv6/ipv6_sockglue.c in the Linux kernel through 5.1.5. There is an unchecked kmalloc of new_ra, which might allow an attacker to cause a denial of service (NULL pointer dereference and system crash).<br/>CVE-2019-12381: An issue was discovered in ip_ra_control in net/ipv4/ip_sockglue.c in the Linux kernel through 5.1.5. There is an unchecked kmalloc of new_ra, which might allow an attacker to cause a denial of service (NULL pointer dereference and system crash).<br/>CVE-2019-15239: In the Linux kernel, a certain net/ipv4/tcp_output.c change, which was properly incorporated into 4.16.12, was incorrectly backported to the earlier longterm kernels, introducing a new vulnerability that was potentially more severe than the issue that was intended to be fixed by backporting. Specifically, by adding to a write queue between disconnection and re-connection, a local attacker can trigger multiple use-after-free conditions. This can result in a kernel crash, or potentially in privilege escalation. <br/>CVE-2019-19062: A memory leak in the crypto_report() function in crypto/crypto_user_base.c in the Linux kernel through 5.3.11 allows attackers to cause a denial of service (memory consumption) by triggering crypto_report_alg() failures, aka CID-ffdde5932042.<br/>CVE-2019-19537: In the Linux kernel before 5.2.10, there is a race condition bug that can be caused by a malicious USB device in the USB character device driver layer, aka CID-303911cfc5b9. This affects drivers/usb/core/file.c.<br/>CVE-2019-20054: In the Linux kernel before 5.0.6, there is a NULL pointer dereference in drop_sysctl_table() in fs/proc/proc_sysctl.c, related to put_links, aka CID-23da9588037e. | 3.0.0-3.7.11 | |
| <a name="CM-27670"></a> [CM-27670](#CM-27670) | A memory leak in `switchd` might occur, which causes `switchd` to restart. | 3.7.10-3.7.11 | |
| <a name="CM-27644"></a> [CM-27644](#CM-27644) | Ifupdown2 does not set up the front panel interface for the `dhclient` to accept the DHCP OFFER.<br/>To work around this issue, restart the networking service after `ifreload -a` with the `systemctl restart networking` command. | 3.7.10-3.7.11 | |
| <a name="CM-27525"></a> [CM-27525](#CM-27525) | On the Delta AG6248C PoE switch, if the PoE priority is set to low on some ports, other ports with a higher priority might have their requests to draw power rejected instead of the lower priority ports being brought down. | 3.7.11 | |
| <a name="CM-27507"></a> [CM-27507](#CM-27507) | The `ports.conf` file on the Dell S5248F-ON switch does not show port ganging or breakout options. | 3.7.10-3.7.11 | |
| <a name="CM-27496"></a> [CM-27496](#CM-27496) | All Broadcom Trident3 X7 switches contain PCIE firmware, which is programmed by the vendor when the switch is manufactured. The latest version of this firmware (2.6) is incompatible with Cumulus Linux 3.7.11 and earlier, and Cumulus Linux 4.0. <br/>To work around this issue, downgrade the Broadcom ASIC firmware to an earlier version. | 3.7.11 | |
| <a name="CM-27444"></a> [CM-27444](#CM-27444) | If you use the NCLU commands to configure NTP and run the `net add time ntp source <interface>` command before you run the `net add time ntp server <server> iburst` command, the `/etc/ntp.conf` file is misconfigured.<br/>To work around this issue, run the `net add time ntp server <server> iburst` command before you run the `net add time ntp source <interface>` command. | 3.7.10-3.7.11 | |
| <a name="CM-27295"></a> [CM-27295](#CM-27295) | IPv6 table rules might affect forwarding. For example, if you create the following rule in the `/etc/cumulus/acl/policy.d/03-sshd.rules` file, the rule counter increments but IPv4 SSH traffic might be dropped.<br /><pre>&#91;ip6tables&#93;<br />-A INPUT -p tcp --dport 22 -j DROP<br /></pre><br /> | 3.7.2-3.7.11 | |
| <a name="CM-27120"></a> [CM-27120](#CM-27120) | When an interface flap occurs, numbered IPv6 BGP sessions might fail to establish.<br/>To work around this issue, run the `ip -6 route flush cache <IPv6-address>` command to flush the IPv6 route cache. | 3.7.9-3.7.11 | |
| <a name="CM-26894"></a> [CM-26894](#CM-26894) | The `neighmgrd` service does not ignore neighbors on reserved devices (lo and management devices).  This issue is not seen when management VRF is enabled. | 3.7.8-3.7.11 | |
| <a name="CM-26839"></a> [CM-26839](#CM-26839) | On the Dell S5248F-ON switch, CPU core temp sensors may show as ABSENT. |  | |
| <a name="CM-26351"></a> [CM-26351](#CM-26351) | After you remove a subinterface, the BGP session stays in a Connect state. | 3.7.8-3.7.11 | |
| <a name="CM-26241"></a> [CM-26241](#CM-26241) | On the Dell S5248F-ON switch, `smond` might generate syslog messages indicating that the fan input RPM is lower than the normal low speed of 2500 RPM. Speeds as low as 1700 RPM are acceptable in normal thermal environments; therefore, you can ignore these messages. | 3.7.6-3.7.11 | |
| <a name="CM-25665"></a> [CM-25665](#CM-25665) | On the Broadcom Trident 3 switch, VXLAN encapsulated packets are dropped on the ingress port (tagged layer 2 port) during transit forwarding (the local switch does not terminate the VXLAN tunnel). An example of where this two-layer VXLAN inside VXLAN encapsulation might occur:<ul class="alternate" type="square">	<li>VXLAN tunnel (#1) between two servers (different racks) to provide layer 2 extension for containers or VM hosts.</li>	<li>VXLAN tunnel (#2) between the TOR switch in rack 1 to the TOR switch located in the remote rack.</li></ul>To work around this issue, either:<ul class="alternate" type="square">	<li>Configure the edge port (facing the servers) to be an access port (instead of a trunk/tagged port)</li>	<li>Change the destination port from 4789 to something else (VXLAN tunnel terminated by the servers)</li></ul> | 3.7.5-3.7.11 | |
| <a name="CM-22591"></a> [CM-22591](#CM-22591) | CVE-2018-5391 (FragmentSmack) is a network vulnerability where an attacker can trigger time and calculation expensive fragment reassembly with specially crafted packets, leading to a denial of service. On a Cumulus Linux switch, the impact is limited to control plane and management plane traffic. Any control plane traffic coming in the front panel ports will be limited by existing policer ACLs.<br/>To work around this issue, create a file called `/etc/sysctl.d/ip.conf` and add these settings:<br /><pre>net.ipv4.ipfrag_low_thresh = 196608<br />net.ipv6.ip6frag_low_thresh = 196608<br />net.ipv4.ipfrag_high_thresh = 262144<br />net.ipv6.ip6frag_high_thresh = 262144<br /></pre><br /> | 3.7.0-3.7.11 | |

| <a name="CM-17934"></a> [CM-17934](#CM-17934) <a name="CM-17934"></a> | FRR tracks interface speed based on the value it learns from the Linux kernel for that interface. If the interface speed changes, FRR does not update its interface speed cache. This can lead to issues for routing protocols that derive metrics from interface speed as the cost can become out of sync with the interface speed.<br/>To work around this issue, manually define the routing protocol metric for these interfaces or restart FRR. | 3.7.6-3.7.12 | |

| <a name="CM-17494"></a> [CM-17494](#CM-17494) <a name="CM-17494"></a> | In certain cases, a peer device sends an ARP request from a source IP address that is not on the connected subnet and the switch creates a STALE neighbor entry. Eventually, the switch attempts to keep the entry fresh and sends ARP requests to the host. If the host responds, the switch has REACHABLE neighbor entries for hosts that are not on the connected subnet. <br/>To work around this issue, change the value of `arp_ignore` to 2.

All of these require untrusted local user access.CVE-2017-9525 is a local user privilege escalation attack: In the cron package through 3.0pl1-128 on Debian, and through 3.0pl1-128ubuntu2 on Ubuntu, the postinst maintainer script allows for group-crontab-to-root privilege escalation via symlink attacks against unsafe usage of the chown and chmod programs.<br/>CVE-2019-9704, CVE-2019-9705, CVE-2019-9706 are local user denial of service attacks.  Note: the fix for CVE-2019-9705 imposes a limitation on the length of a crontab file (the vulnerability was that an unlimited size crontab file could cause excessive memory consumption).<br/><a href="https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/DLA-1723-1" class="external-link" rel="nofollow">https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/DLA-1723-1</a> | 3.0.0-3.7.12 | |

There is an unchecked kmalloc of new_ra, which might allow an attacker to cause a denial of service (NULL pointer dereference and system crash).<br/>CVE-2019-12381: An issue was discovered in ip_ra_control in net/ipv4/ip_sockglue.c in the Linux kernel through 5.1.5. There is an unchecked kmalloc of new_ra, which might allow an attacker to cause a denial of service (NULL pointer dereference and system crash).<br/>CVE-2019-15239: In the Linux kernel, a certain net/ipv4/tcp_output.c change, which was properly incorporated into 4.16.12, was incorrectly backported to the earlier longterm kernels, introducing a new vulnerability that was potentially more severe than the issue that was intended to be fixed by backporting. Specifically, by adding to a write queue between disconnection and re-connection, a local attacker can trigger multiple use-after-free conditions. This can result in a kernel crash, or potentially in privilege escalation. <br/>CVE-2019-19062: A memory leak in the crypto_report() function in crypto/crypto_user_base.c in the Linux kernel through 5.3.11 allows attackers to cause a denial of service (memory consumption) by triggering crypto_report_alg() failures, aka CID-ffdde5932042.<br/>CVE-2019-19537: In the Linux kernel before 5.2.10, there is a race condition bug that can be caused by a malicious USB device in the USB character device driver layer, aka CID-303911cfc5b9.

This problem is rare and can occur only in EVPN configurations that have user-configured route targets (RTs) for tenant VRFs, and only following a restart of FRR.<br/>To work around this issue, either restart the FRR service on the affected switch with the `sudo systemctl restart frr.service` command or bounce the layer 3 SVI for the affected VRF; for example:<br /><pre>ifdown vlan123 ; sleep 2 ; ifup vlan123<br /></pre><br />You can run the `net show vrf vni` command to print a mapping of VRF : L3-VNI : L3-SVI. | 3.7.5-3.7.12 | |

This can fill up the application socket buffers resulting in `No buffer space available` error messages on protocol sockets.<br/>When the driver recovers, it automatically resumes the transmit queues. In most cases these error messages are transient. In rare cases, the hardware queues might get stuck, which you can recover with a `switchd` restart. | 3.4.3-3.7.12 | |

All of these require untrusted local user access.CVE-2017-9525 is a local user privilege escalation attack: In the cron package through 3.0pl1-128 on Debian, and through 3.0pl1-128ubuntu2 on Ubuntu, the postinst maintainer script allows for group-crontab-to-root privilege escalation via symlink attacks against unsafe usage of the chown and chmod programs.<br/>CVE-2019-9704, CVE-2019-9705, CVE-2019-9706 are local user denial of service attacks.  Note: the fix for CVE-2019-9705 imposes a limitation on the length of a crontab file (the vulnerability was that an unlimited size crontab file could cause excessive memory consumption).<br/><a href="https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/DLA-1723-1" class="external-link" rel="nofollow">https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/DLA-1723-1</a> | 3.0.0-3.7.12 | |

| <a name="CM-16571"></a> [CM-16571](#CM-16571) <a name="CM-16571"></a> | NCLU cannot manage `rsyslog` to addresses routed via a VRF.  In Cumulus Linux 4.0.0 and later, management VRF is enabled by default.   To work around this issue, update the `/etc/network/interfaces` file to disable management VRF. | 3.4.3-3.7.12 | |
| <a name="CM-15812"></a> [CM-15812](#CM-15812) <a name="CM-15812"></a> | Multicast forwarding fails for IP addresses whose DMAC overlaps with reserved DIPs. | 3.2.1-3.7.12 | |
| <a name="CM-15601"></a> [CM-15601](#CM-15601) <a name="CM-15601"></a> | On a Mellanox switch in an MLAG environment, a packet from a dually connected host might ingress on one switch but the MAC DA is destined to the router on the peer switch. The packet will traverse the peer link but is not excluded from port isolation (or egress mask) filtering. Similarly, an IP multicast packet might traverse the peer link and need to be routed. | 3.6.2-3.7.12 | |
| <a name="CM-15094"></a> [CM-15094](#CM-15094) <a name="CM-15094"></a> | Counter samples for an 80G bond (2 x 40G) exported from the switch show an interface speed (ifSpeed) of 14.464Gbps.  | 3.2.0-3.7.12 | |
| <a name="CM-13316"></a> [CM-13316](#CM-13316) <a name="CM-13316"></a> | When you try to remove a VNI from a bridge using a regex match, the VNI is added back when you run the `ifreload -a` command. | 3.1.1-3.7.10 | 3.7.11-3.7.12|
| <a name="CM-12967"></a> [CM-12967](#CM-12967) <a name="CM-12967"></a> | When link pause or priority flow control (PFC) is enabled on a Broadcom Tomahawk-based switch and there is over-subscription on a link, the ASIC sends pause frames aggressively, causing the upstream switch to not throttle enough. <br/>If you need link pause or PFC functionality, you must use a switch that does not use the Tomahawk ASIC. | 3.1.0-3.7.6 | 3.7.7-3.7.12|
