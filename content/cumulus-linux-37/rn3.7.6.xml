<td><p>The following CVEs were announced that affect the cron package.  All of these require untrusted local user access.</p>

<p>CVE-2017-9525 is a local user privilege escalation attack: In the cron package through 3.0pl1-128 on Debian, and through 3.0pl1-128ubuntu2 on Ubuntu, the postinst maintainer script allows for group-crontab-to-root privilege escalation via symlink attacks against unsafe usage of the chown and chmod programs.<br/>
CVE-2019-9704, CVE-2019-9705, CVE-2019-9706 are local user denial of service attacks.  Note: the fix for CVE-2019-9705 imposes a limitation on the length of a crontab file (the vulnerability was that an unlimited size crontab file could cause excessive memory consumption).<br/>

rsyslogd, when receiving remote log messages and using optional pmaixforwardedfrom or pmcisconames parser modules (not enabled by default on Cumulus Linux), is vulnerable to CVE-2019-17041 and CVE-2019-17042 where malicious messages that appear to be from AIX or Cisco respectively may be caused to skip sanity checks, resulting in incorrect negative lengths causing heap overflows.<br/>
Do not enable (with $UDPServerRun or $InputTCPServerRun) receiving syslog messages from other hosts by the network. Also, do not enable (with $ModLoad) the vulnerable parsers pmaixforwardedfrom or pmcisconames.\<br/>
The default /etc/rsyslog.conf file on Cumulus Linux does NOT enable $UDPServerRun or $InputTCPServerRun, so the vulnerability is not network exploitable in the default configuration. In addition, the vulnerable parsers are not enabled in the default configuration.</p></td>

CVE-2019-12378: An issue was discovered in ip6_ra_control in net/ipv6/ipv6_sockglue.c in the Linux kernel through 5.1.5. There is an unchecked kmalloc of new_ra, which might allow an attacker to cause a denial of service (NULL pointer dereference and system crash).<br/>
CVE-2019-12381: An issue was discovered in ip_ra_control in net/ipv4/ip_sockglue.c in the Linux kernel through 5.1.5. There is an unchecked kmalloc of new_ra, which might allow an attacker to cause a denial of service (NULL pointer dereference and system crash).<br/>
CVE-2019-15239: In the Linux kernel, a certain net/ipv4/tcp_output.c change, which was properly incorporated into 4.16.12, was incorrectly backported to the earlier longterm kernels, introducing a new vulnerability that was potentially more severe than the issue that was intended to be fixed by backporting. Specifically, by adding to a write queue between disconnection and re-connection, a local attacker can trigger multiple use-after-free conditions. This can result in a kernel crash, or potentially in privilege escalation. <br/>
CVE-2019-19062: A memory leak in the crypto_report() function in crypto/crypto_user_base.c in the Linux kernel through 5.3.11 allows attackers to cause a denial of service (memory consumption) by triggering crypto_report_alg() failures, aka CID-ffdde5932042.<br/>
CVE-2019-19537: In the Linux kernel before 5.2.10, there is a race condition bug that can be caused by a malicious USB device in the USB character device driver layer, aka CID-303911cfc5b9. This affects drivers/usb/core/file.c.<br/>
CVE-2019-20054: In the Linux kernel before 5.0.6, there is a NULL pointer dereference in drop_sysctl_table() in fs/proc/proc_sysctl.c, related to put_links, aka CID-23da9588037e.</p></td>

The problem is caused by a race condition when programming the anycast IP address (used to terminate VXLAN tunnels), where the hardware is programmed before the software by clagd.<br/>
To work around this issue, configure the BGP path across the peer link to be less preferred. The example below uses AS path prepending and the MLAG switches are iBGP neighbors. However, other BGP configurations achieve the same result. <br/>

 Debian Bugs: 930020, 930024 <br/>
 getchar.c in Vim before 8.1.1365 and Neovim before 0.3.6 allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary OS commands via the :source! command in a modeline, as demonstrated by execute in Vim, and assert_fails or nvim_input in Neovim. <br/>

 Cumulus Networks recommends that you disable modelines in the the vimrc file (set nomodeline) to use the securemodelines plugin or to disable modelineexpr (since patch 8.1.1366, Vim-only) to disallow expressions in modelines. <br/>
 To check if you have modelines enabled, open vim and enter: <br/>
 :set modeline? <br/>
 If vim returns nomodeline, you are <em>not</em> vulnerable. If you are vulnerable or you want to ensure your security with this issue, add these lines to your vimrc file: </p>
 
 
 set modelines=0 
 set nomodeline 
 
 
<p> modeline is enabled by default. <br/>
 Verify that you do not have any existing lines in .vimrc that set modelines or modeline.</p></td>

After you remove the link-speed, ethtool shows the advertised link modes as not reported and Speed/Duplex as unknown.<br/>
To work around this issue and bring the interface back up, either restart switchd or use ethtool to configure the speed, advertised, duplex or MDI-X settings. <br/>
