## What is Cumulus Linux?

Cumulus Linux is the first full-featured Linux operating system for the networking industry. The {{<exlink url="https://www.debian.org/releases/buster/" text="Debian Buster" >}}-based, networking-focused distribution runs on hardware produced by a {{<exlink url="https://cumulusnetworks.com/hcl/" text="broad partner ecosystem" >}}, ensuring unmatched customer choice regarding silicon, optics, cables, and systems.

This user guide provides in-depth documentation on the Cumulus Linux installation process, system configuration and management, network solutions, and monitoring and troubleshooting recommendations. In addition, the quick start guide provides an end-to-end setup process to get you started.

Cumulus Linux 4.0 includes the latest NetQ agent and CLI, which is installed by default on the Cumulus Linux switch. Use NetQ to monitor and manage your data center network infrastructure and operational health. Refer to the {{<exlink url="https://docs.cumulusnetworks.com/cumulus-netq/" text="NetQ documentation" >}} for details.
